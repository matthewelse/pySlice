pySlice
==========

A 3D model Slicing algorithm, written by Matthew Else in Python. Written, firstly because I need a nice algorithm in Python, and secondly because alternative solutions are all licensed under AGPL, and I need a solution for myself that can be used commercially without releasing source code for everything else.

The code currently only supports the following file formats:
* STL

I plan to possibly support other formats such as OBJ, for example however at the moment STL is fine. It currently cannot generate G-Code, and all it will take is a for loop to generate all of the layers.

If you test pySlice successfully or unsuccessfully, let me know in the issues section of Github.
